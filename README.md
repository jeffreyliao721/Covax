# CoVax: Covid Vaccination app
* CoVax was created during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic with a mission to encourage the community to get vaccinated through an interactive forum platform.
* With the help of mobile cloud computing, user authentication and data are stored and uploaded. Along with Google APIs, users are able to locate nearby vaccination sites in the Stony Brook, Long Island area.
* Created entirely in Android Studios but the main project source code is provided here.
